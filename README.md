# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-SVM
In this project I focus on developing a model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) which could correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. Thus, I have performed Data Analysis using Python to accept or reject the hypothesis : " Scientist claims that the Digits data set of scikit-learn library predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times "
